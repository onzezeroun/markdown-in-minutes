# Lists

## Ordered Lists

To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers do not have to be sequential.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

Or

1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third item
1. Fourth item

## Unordered Lists

To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items.

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

or

* First item
* Second item
* Third item
* Fourth item

or

+ First item
+ Second item
+ Third item
+ Fourth item

## Combining the two

1. First ordered list item
1. Second ordered list item (which shows as 2.)
1. (Markdown ignores the written number in favor of enumerating by integer)
   - Indented lists require four spaces in most specifications
   - Sublists are implementation specific
   - Try it out and render to be sure it works
1. Continuing the list after an indentation
